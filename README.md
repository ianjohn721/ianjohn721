- 👋 Hi, I’m @ianjohn721
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a redirection app its just simple and it helps a lot to my small business.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript wherein I convert it into an app and its job is just to redirect to another website
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this project since I am just a "newbie" and honestly I just use chatGPT for its coding and I think something is still missing tho
- 📫 How to reach me is only here in this beautiful place. Thanks
